Image Captioning with Flask and BLIP Model
This project uses the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model from Hugging Face to generate captions for images. A Flask-based API handles image uploads and returns captions generated by the model.

Requirements
Python 3.6+
Pip (for package management)
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install manually:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers Pillow Flask
Usage
1. Run the Flask API
bash
Copy code
python app.py
The API will run at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. Sending a Request
Use curl or Postman to send a POST request with an image to /generate-caption:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "image=@path_to_your_image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate-caption
3. Response
The response will be a JSON object with the generated caption:

json
Copy code
{
  "caption": "A dog running through a field with a ball in its mouth."
}
